## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19 or later
- TrueFinals API credentials (User ID and API Key)

### Building the Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd NHRL-MCP

# Build the server
go build -o truefinals-mcp-server

# Or use the pre-built binary
chmod +x truefinals-mcp-server
```

### Configuration

The server requires TrueFinals API credentials. Set them using environment variables:

```bash
export TRUEFINALS_API_USER_ID="your_user_id"
export TRUEFINALS_API_KEY="your_api_key"

# Optional configuration
export TRUEFINALS_BASE_URL="https://truefinals.com/api"  # Custom API base URL
export TRUEFINALS_TOOLS="full"                           # Tool filter mode
export TRUEFINALS_DISABLED_TOOLS="tournaments,games"     # Disable specific tools
```

Or pass them as command-line arguments:

```bash
./truefinals-mcp-server -api-user-id "your_user_id" -api-key "your_api_key"
```

### Usage

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start the server with default settings
./truefinals-mcp-server

# Start with specific credentials
./truefinals-mcp-server -api-user-id "your_user_id" -api-key "your_api_key"
```

#### Tool Filtering
The server supports filtering available tools based on safety and permission levels:

```bash
# Show only reporting tools (read-only operations)
./truefinals-mcp-server -tools reporting

# Show safe modification tools (excludes dangerous operations)
./truefinals-mcp-server -tools full-safe

# Show all tools (default)
./truefinals-mcp-server -tools full
```

#### Available Tool Modes:
- **`reporting`**: Read-only operations (list, get operations)
- **`full-safe`**: Safe modification operations (excludes delete, reset, bulk operations)
- **`full`**: All operations (default)

#### Command Line Options
```bash
Usage: ./truefinals-mcp-server [options]

Options:

## MCP Integration

### Connecting to AI Assistants

The server implements the Model Context Protocol and can be integrated with compatible AI assistants like Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible applications.

Example MCP configuration for Claude Desktop:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "truefinals": {
      "command": "/path/to/truefinals-mcp-server",
      "args": ["-api-user-id", "your_user_id", "-api-key", "your_api_key"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

To use with Claude Desktop, add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Ready-to-use configuration (copy and paste this into your Claude Desktop config):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "truefinals": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/truefinals-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "-api-user-id", "YOUR_TRUEFINALS_USER_ID",
        "-api-key", "YOUR_TRUEFINALS_API_KEY"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_TRUEFINALS_USER_ID` and `YOUR_TRUEFINALS_API_KEY` with your actual TrueFinals API credentials.
