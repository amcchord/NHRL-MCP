## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19 or later
- TrueFinals API credentials (User ID and API Key) for tournament management features

### Building the Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd NHRL-MCP

# Build the server
go build -o nhrl-mcp-server

# Or use the pre-built binary
chmod +x nhrl-mcp-server
```

### Configuration

#### For TrueFinals Features
The server requires TrueFinals API credentials for tournament management features:

```bash
export TRUEFINALS_API_USER_ID="your_user_id"
export TRUEFINALS_API_KEY="your_api_key"

# Optional TrueFinals configuration
export TRUEFINALS_BASE_URL="https://truefinals.com/api"  # Custom API base URL
export TRUEFINALS_TOOLS="full"                           # Tool filter mode
export TRUEFINALS_DISABLED_TOOLS="tournaments,games"     # Disable specific tools
export TRUEFINALS_READ_ONLY="true"                       # Enable read-only mode
```

#### For NHRL Features
NHRL statistics features work without additional configuration - they access public NHRL APIs directly.

### Usage

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start the server (NHRL stats work immediately, TrueFinals requires credentials)
./nhrl-mcp-server

# Start with TrueFinals credentials for full functionality
./nhrl-mcp-server -api-user-id "your_user_id" -api-key "your_api_key"
```

#### Tool Filtering
The server supports filtering available tools based on safety and permission levels:

```bash
# Show only reporting tools (read-only operations)
./nhrl-mcp-server -tools reporting

# Show safe modification tools (excludes dangerous operations)
./nhrl-mcp-server -tools full-safe

# Show all tools (default)
./nhrl-mcp-server -tools full
```

#### Read-Only Mode
For maximum safety, you can enable read-only mode which only allows read operations regardless of the tools mode:

```bash
# Enable read-only mode via CLI flag
./nhrl-mcp-server -read-only

# Enable read-only mode via environment variable
export TRUEFINALS_READ_ONLY=true
./nhrl-mcp-server

# Read-only mode works with any tools mode and overrides it
./nhrl-mcp-server -tools full -read-only  # Still only allows read operations
```

#### Available Tool Modes:
- **`reporting`**: Read-only operations (list, get operations) - safest mode
- **`full-safe`**: Safe modification operations (excludes delete, reset, disqualify operations)
- **`full`**: All operations including potentially destructive ones
- **Read-only mode**: Only read operations allowed (overrides all tool modes when enabled)

#### Command Line Options
```bash
Usage: ./nhrl-mcp-server [options]

Options:
  -api-user-id string     API User ID for TrueFinals service
  -api-key string         API key for TrueFinals service  
  -base-url string        Base URL for TrueFinals API (optional)
  -tools string           Tools mode: reporting, full-safe, full
  -disabled-tools string  Comma-separated list of tool names to disable
  -read-only              Enable read-only mode - only allow read operations
  -exit-after-first       Exit after processing the first request
  -version               Show version information and exit
  -help                  Show help information
```

## Claude Desktop Integration

### Installation

The easiest way to use this MCP server is with Claude Desktop. Here's the complete setup:

#### Step 1: Install the Server

```bash
# Download and install to system location
sudo cp nhrl-mcp-server /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nhrl-mcp-server
```

#### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Configuration Examples

  "mcpServers": {
    "nhrl": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/nhrl-mcp-server",
      "args": ["-tools", "reporting"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Full Functionality with TrueFinals (Recommended)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nhrl": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/nhrl-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "-api-user-id", "YOUR_TRUEFINALS_USER_ID",
        "-api-key", "YOUR_TRUEFINALS_API_KEY",
        "-tools", "full-safe"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Using Environment Variables
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nhrl": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/nhrl-mcp-server",
      "args": ["-tools", "full-safe"],
      "env": {
        "TRUEFINALS_API_USER_ID": "YOUR_TRUEFINALS_USER_ID",
        "TRUEFINALS_API_KEY": "YOUR_TRUEFINALS_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 4: Read-Only Mode (Maximum Safety)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nhrl": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/nhrl-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "-api-user-id", "YOUR_TRUEFINALS_USER_ID",
        "-api-key", "YOUR_TRUEFINALS_API_KEY",
        "-read-only"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 5: NHRL-Only Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nhrl-stats": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/nhrl-mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "-disabled-tools", "truefinals_tournaments,truefinals_games,truefinals_locations,truefinals_players,truefinals_bracket"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace** `YOUR_TRUEFINALS_USER_ID` and `YOUR_TRUEFINALS_API_KEY` with your actual TrueFinals API credentials if you want tournament management features.

### Example Usage with Claude

### New Feature: Live Fight Stats

The `get_live_fight_stats` operation provides detailed, up-to-date statistics for a specific bot with head-to-head data against an opponent in a tournament context.

**Parameters:**
- `bot1` (required): First bot name for comparison
- `bot2` (required): Second bot name - stats will be returned for this bot
- `tournament_id` (required): Tournament ID (e.g., 'nhrl_june25_30lb')

**Returns:**
- Detailed stats for bot2 including:
  - Driver information (name, pronunciation, location, pronouns)
  - Bot details (type, ranking, builder background)
  - Overall fight statistics (wins, losses, KOs, judge decisions)
  - Head-to-head record against bot1
  - Last meeting date if applicable
